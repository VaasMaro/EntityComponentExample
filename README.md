# EntityComponentExample


Hey that's a C++ game engine, a work in progress.

I'm using SFML, and that's a Entity-componentbased engine.

currently something like 4000 line of code and 60 classes.

if you want to run it on your computer please just put all the file in the same folder without subfolder (Visual Studio filters allow me to do this stuff without shame)
